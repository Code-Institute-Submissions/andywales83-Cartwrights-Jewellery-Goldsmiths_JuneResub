# **Cartwright's Jewellery & Goldsmiths**

Cartwright's Jewellery & Goldsmiths, is the final Milestone project, specifically built for the Django modules of the Code Institute's - Full Stack Software Development Diploma. The scope and idea for this project, were to plan, design and build an e-commerce website, that gives users all of the same functionality of any other general e-commerce based website. The project is built around an idea for an online Jewellery store, with a view to possibly being used as a full production site for a family member, when the course has been completed.
